I took a look at Facebook's 'react' repository that is 'a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.' I peeked at their issues and saw that there were so, so many. There were pages upon pages of opened issues and new ones pop up every few hours or so. Basically all of the closed issues weren't ever resolved and were closed due to the team thinking there won't be a forseeable fix in the near future. Pull requests happen every couple days and are looked at by some sort of checker. A majority of the requests do pass the checker, but a lot of them never get closed as issues or ever get merged into the main branch. It's interesting to see how a monolith like Facebook works. Seeing the various problems being fixed but never getting approved really shows how many loops it must take to jump through to approve a new build version.
